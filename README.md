# 🎲 Tycoon — Monopoly Tycoon on Base

## Overview

**Tycoon** is an exciting blockchain-based tycoon game inspired by the classic **Monopoly** board game, built on the **Base Network (Ethereum Layer 2 by Coinbase)**.  
Players can **buy, sell, and trade virtual properties as NFTs**, collect rent, build monopolies, and compete in a **decentralized on-chain economy**.

This project combines **strategic gameplay** with **true ownership** and **transparent mechanics** using smart contracts.

> 🚧 Currently in active development — Frontend (React + Next.js) and smart contracts are being actively improved. Join the journey!
